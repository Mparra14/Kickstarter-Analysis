# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to break down the data provided to help Louise find which theater campaign was the most successful in the shortest amount of time. Using excel we were able to analyze which months produced the highest amount of successful theater campaigns, and which months would not be good to start campaigns on. We were also able to determine which campaign goals would have a higher percentage of being successful, this would help Louise keep her campaign goal in a reasonable amount range.
