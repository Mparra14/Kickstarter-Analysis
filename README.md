# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to break down the data provided to help Louise find which theater campaign was the most successful in the shortest amount of time. Using excel we were able to analyze which months produced the highest amount of successful theater campaigns, and which months would not be good to start campaigns on. We were also able to determine which campaign goals would have a higher percentage of being successful, this would help Louise keep her campaign goal in a reasonable amount range. 
## Analysis and Challanges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

* Looking at this graph you are able to see that the most successful months for campaigns are in May, June and even July. You can also see that by the end of the year the successful campaigns dwindle especially in December.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* This graph determines which campaign goal was successful in the theater category. It becomes clear that most of the successful campaigns have goals that range between $1000 to $5000.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* One of the main challenges from this project was dealing with so much raw data and having to break it down into an understandable amount. One of the best techniques to narrow down the information was by filtering the columns and getting rid of data that is not necessiraly needed to help Louise's campaign. 
* Another challange from this project was actually having to convert Unix timestamps to actual dates, I had never encountered this format, but the conversion was needed since we based all the results from our date conversion column. 
## Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* The two main conclusions from the analysis of Launch date were that the best months that had a significant amount of success rates were in the months of May and June. While the month of December had a significantly lower amount of success. It would be best, according to the findings, to hold campaigns during the months of May and June, and deter from campaigning at the end of the year. 


What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* In this graph you can see that campaign goals should be kept below the $5000 mark. From the data, the vast majority of successful campaigns had goals of a $1000 and as it gets to the $5000 target the graphs dips. Therefore, for a successful campaign keep the goal below $5000.


What are some limitations of this dataset?
* One of the limitations from this data might be that it was only collected from 2014-2017, in order to see a better trend in successful campaigns it will need a few more years worth of data to actually be able to predict a better outcome for the client.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One graph that we can incorporate for the outcomes of the launch date might be bar graphs, while line graphs are very discriptive, bar graphs might be able to differentiate the differences a bit better in a visual way. Bar graphs are also much easier to read than line graphs.
